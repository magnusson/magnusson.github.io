This is just a cheesy first post to get some content up on the site. Planning to write more useful stuff in the near future.
The site is a WIP so there is still more things to come and improvements to be made.

If you care about how this is built you can find the sorce at <a href="https://github.com/magnusson/magnusson.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a> otherwise you can just look at this cute fox.
