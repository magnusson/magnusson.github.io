I just have to recommend this game. It's a short story driven game where you explore the history of the Finch family.
You play as a seventeen year old girl named Edith that returns to her old home with a key she inherited from her mother.
Going through the game you will get the story of each and every family member who lived in the house in a unique and engaging way.

There is not much to say about this game then that it is an masterpiece in the story driven games and really sets a high bar for story driven games to come.
It is really something everyone should experience for themselves. The storytelling puts you through a mix of emotions and is so well implemented all through the game.
The graphics really fits the atmosphere for the game and everything feels so well put together.

Just do yourself a favor and pick up this game when you have the chance you will not regret it when you finish it.
