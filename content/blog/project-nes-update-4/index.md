Slowly completing more and more games, some games are taking way longer to complete than I expected. Metal Gear was a great example of this, not sure how many hours it took to get through that one.

This was a game for my taste. I mostly enjoyed it, plenty of continues and ammo. Even if the aim/controls was a bit funky at times, especially when aiming diagonal, overall the game felt solid. I really hated the mystery boxes that could either kill you our give you a continue so I mostly choose to ignore them.
I never understood the NPC guys you needed to save at the T-Rex boss so I just ended up spamming the boss as fast as possible to avoid having to deal with them.

Somewhat fun racing game, I did not do that well and made it to race 25 or something. Could not find if the game is endless if you do well enough. I often got stuck on curves trying to take them way too tight making me place second or third on some races.

Never heard or seen anything about this game before. But I am glad I got to play it. A really solid and fun game! I just enjoyed it from start to finish, fun characters to play and even the bosses (though often similar) was very enjoyable. Would really recommend playing through this game.

I really wanted to like this game, played it as a kid but got nowhere and I now understand why. The beginning you get thrown right into the action and it takes quite a few deaths to get used to the game. I was using the map that came with the game to figure out and find my way which made it less painful to grind through. My first playthrough I ended up softlocked because I accidentally killed hostages when skipping text so I could not get the rank for the compass and the Rocket launcher. Not sure I would have figured out how to get them by myself even if I had the correct rank since it was a bit cryptic and I got it spoiled for me when looking up why the rooms where empty.

The game was enjoyable even with the bits that where really annoying like the pitfalls and rollers that oneshot you. I guess the most annoying part was dying and having to run so far each time, especially at the start of the game.
