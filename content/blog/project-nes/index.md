I've seen quite a few people trying to complete the full list of games released to a platform. So I've decided to try it out with all the games released for the NES in Sweden.
There was 210 games officially released in Sweden, more then enough for a longer project.

The way I plan to do things is to pick a random game and try to complete it.
I count a completed game when I get to credits, no need to 100% the game.

I have already completed three games so I will list them and write a bit what I thought about them.

Decided to play it even when I had not tried the first game. Some levels was really hard to figure out and had to check some solutions. But overall I enjoyed the game.

A classic, hard platforms jump but with plenty of time for each level so completing it is not that hard. The jumps at the bonus parts is really painful.

Five "mini-games" that I had to replay way to many times to complete mostly because of the stiff controls.
