But have now getting to complete a few more shorter games.\r\nI've now completed 33 out of the total 210 games, so there is still lots of games left.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></h2>\n<p>In the beginning of this game I was really enjoying it, but the more I played the more frustrating it became, dying in a palace just to have to run all the way back and loosing all progress. It got really repetitive and I don't know if I was underleveled at the end or if the game really should be that difficult at the end. I also had a hard time progressing at one point when I could not figure out how to find all Magic Containers so I had to look it up. I also had trouble finding the hidden town since I had not understood that the hammer could also remove trees and not just stones.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to enjoy this game but had a really hard time doing so. But still feels good to have it completed.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Willow (video game)</a></h2>\n<p>Fun RPG but with very confusing layouts where every screen looks exactly the same and sometimes I started to wonder if it was an endless loop of screens. Sometimes it was hard to find out where to go next to progress the story and find the correct NPC to talk to. But overall I enjoyed this game.</p>\n<p>Last boss got kinda of annoying since I was only level 13 and had to have max MP and not miss a shot, and when if I failed I had to redo most of the castle...</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath_of_the_Black_Manta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wrath of the Black Manta</a></h2>\n<p>A bit of an confusing game, lots of technics to be used but it is pretty easy to just use the shurikens and progress slowly to kill enemies most of the time. I don't think I found any of the doors the hostages was hinting at even though I was trying to spam shoot the walls I thought they told me to shoot at... Was an OK game overall.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bros.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mario Bros. Classic</a></h2>\n<p>A real classic, played multiple version of this game before. Not sure how to complete it but I did 19 phases and seems like 18 phases are speedrun category so I guess that is fine.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dribble_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Double Dribble</a></h2>\n<p>A basic basketball game, most interesting thing about it was the unique menus I guess. No tournament mode so just won a game and was done with it.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Track &#x26; Field in Barcelona</a></h2>\n<p>Button mashing game. Only did one loop of all events. Had some troubles with High Jump and Skeet Shooting until i figured out the timing of things.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project NES Update 6 üó∫Ô∏è"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-nes-update-6/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
