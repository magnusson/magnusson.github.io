I try to go by magnusson on most platforms.\nSome platforms like Battle.net makes it possible for multiple people to have the same name but with a unique identifier for each account.\nOthers like GitHub, Twitter, Instagram and Twitch requires an unique username for each account.</p>\n<p>Getting the username you want from platforms like these differs quite a lot and the policy on inactive usernames is not always clear. I just want to point out that I do not have an issue with the first come first served policy regarding usernames. It's the inactive account policy I want to talk about in this post.</p>\n<p>Let's start looking at the platform that I had the least issues with getting the username I wanted.</p>\n<h2>GitHub</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-username-policy\">Github's policy</a> quite clearly states that usernames should belong to active users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GitHub account names are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and are intended for immediate and active use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With instructions on how to request a username and that is what I used after seeing that the username seemed to be inactive.</p>\n<p>I'm really impressed at the response time from Github. It took about an hour and I was able to register using the username.</p>\n<h2>Twitch</h2>\n<p>Twitch has a <a href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/username-rename-and-recycling-policies?language=en_US\">policy</a> that seems reasonable where they <em>might</em> clear up usernames after 12 months of inactivity. Knowing when or if this is actually happening is not as clear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inactive usernames will be recycled periodically and made available for new users in batches. Legacy justin.tv usernames will eventually be recycled as part of this process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mention of justin.tv is a bit scary since it was shutdown 2014 and these usernames seems to not have been released yet. They do not have a way to request an inactive username so all you can do is check if the username is available from time to time and hope it gets recycled.</p>\n<p>Twitch are at least making an effort to have active usernames on their platform which is step in the right direction.</p>\n<h2>Twitter &#x26; Instagram</h2>\n<p>Lumping these two beasts together as they have somewhat of a similar policy on inactive usernames.</p>\n<p>Instagram gives <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/513717858639392\">this</a> as a suggestion about inactive usernames.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a username you want is being used by an account that seems inactive, you can choose an available version of the username. You can add periods, numbers, underscores or abbreviations to help you come up with a username that's not already in use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I stated at the start of this post I value having the same username on platforms I would personally not want to have different variation on each platform and Instagram does not have a way to even try to request an inactive username.</p>\n<p>Twitters <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts\">policy</a> states that they want people to tweet at least every 6 months or accounts might be permanently removed.</p>\n<p>Even I think removing accounts after 6 months seems a bit harsh but as far as I could see when I looked at getting an inactive username they are not actively removing old and inactive accounts. Without implementing their own policy and not having a way to request an inactive account makes it seemingly impossible to get an inactive username on Twitter.</p>\n<h2>Sherlock</h2>\n<p>If you are trying to get the username that you want on platforms I can recommend <a href=\"https://sherlock-project.github.io/\">Sherlock</a>. This tool scans almost 250 different platforms for the username you want and checks the availability.\nIt's really helpful when trying to get your internet identity on as many platforms as possible. But try to not become a username squatter yourself and only register the username on platforms you are planning to use and be active on.</p>\n<p>The accounts I have with magnusson as the username is now <a href=\"https://github.com/magnusson\">GitHub</a> <a href=\"https://codepen.io/magnusson\">CodePen</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/magnusson\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/magnusson\">Twitch</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Internet Identity üïµÔ∏è‚Äç"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/internet-identity/"}},
