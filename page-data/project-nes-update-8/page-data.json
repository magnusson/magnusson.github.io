So many patterns to learn and having to start grinding power-ups again is not that fun. I just played it slowly and move carefully and completed it after a few tries.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Trevino%27s_Fighting_Golf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf</a></h2>\n<p>Never understood the mechanics of golf games and it shows on the results, played 18 holes and ended up +30... I don't understand how to figure out how long the ball will fly and then it bounces all over the place.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(NES_video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></h2>\n<p>A game I played as a child, but I really can't remember that I made it passed the water level. And the levels just got even harder, the last level was extremely frustrating with the jetpack enemies that I had a really hard time avoiding taking damage from. With the limited amount of health I could find it I died lots of times trying to get through the small corridors.</p>\n<p>It's a game I wanted to enjoy for the nostalgia but it the controls and movement was not enjoyable and that made the game not feel that good.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumshoe_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gumshoe</a></h2>\n<p>The first Zapper game of this project. Really strange game where shooting the character to jump and when you in the end get a gun it's an auto fire.\nManaged to get through the levels but the boss was really hard, not sure if I missed something with him. The blinking and hitboxes felt weird and it took so many hits to kill him.</p>\n<p>Playing the game with a mouse does not give the same feeling as playing with the Zapper but I don't think I would enjoy the game more using it.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Mario\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Mario</a></h2>\n<p>Such a laid back and fun game to pass time with. I really enjoy the mechanics and playstyle of this game. Played through from first start at medium speed and got Game Over at level 19 after a few too many mistakes at the start.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project NES Update 8 üê¢üíä"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-nes-update-8/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
