So I've only completed three more games since last update.\nI have however started two other games that I have not yet managed to get through since they seems like hard games that will take many hours to figure out and complete.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_Triangle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Cobra Triangle</a></h2>\n<p>This game started of as a really fun game but after fifteen minutes of playing and the levels increasing in difficulty it starts to get really frustrating. With really the limited extra lives in the game making a mistake is really punishing. Like accidentally going into a to whirlpool or missing a jump on the waterfall levels makes games could make a good run to a terrible one really quick.</p>\n<p>The button mashing also got old kina quick but got reduced when I started to cheese the game by farming pods in the first level. This made some parts easier but after getting to the level 22 several times and having to reset because of missed waterfall jumps or hitting a whirlpool I had to use a save state to get done with this game.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Key_2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Solomon's Key 2</a></h2>\n<p>Very addictive puzzles, don't know how many times I said \"just one more\" before quitting the game. Really enjoyed everything about this game, a really solid puzzle game. Some levels where a bit to easy and was solved very quickly and others you think you had the solution just to get to the last fire and see that you missed something or placed an ice-block that blocked your path.</p>\n<p>I did not complete the extra levels that was teased after the ending screen. Since this project is about completing games and not 100% them. But I will probably go back and complete them at another date.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Bart_vs._the_Space_Mutants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants</a></h2>\n<p>By far the worst game I've played so far. The controls are not enjoyable at all, the gameplay did not offer much of anything and it even looks bad. So many confusing parts making the game incredibly hard. With no continues and having to replay the first level over and over got old really quickly so I just had to start using save state for this game as well. Even if extra lives was somewhat easy to gather there are so many punishing parts where you instantly die the first time you get there. Hitboxes being way smaller than they look like and just enemy placements that are almost unavoidable or all the missed jumps because of the funky controls.</p>\n<p>Bosses was way to anticlimactic after struggling through a level they were so easy and was not rewarding at all. The last level was somewhat enjoyable since it was not as punishing as any of the levels, but then it was almost too easy instead, especially with the donuts killing everything in the screen.</p>\n<p>This was not a good experience for me in any way.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project NES Update 2 üêç"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-nes-update-2/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
