There is always the new big thing that comes up and you try your best to keep up with what is trending and what is new.\nI struggle with this myself but I try to read up on trends and news as best as I figured I should could write a bit about how I do it.</p>\n<p>I follow a few development podcasts as I've written about in an earlier <a href=\"/developer-podcast\">post</a>. Beside this I read <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Smashing Magazine</a> and often scroll through their twitter timeline where I often find the most interesting posts about many different topics. The diversity of the posts makes it interesting to read and is always good quality.\nAnother good resource I read is the Monthly Web Development Update that you can find <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/anselm-hannemann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The last thing I can recommend doing is checking out <a href=\"https://github.com/trending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GitHub Trending</a> once in a while to see what repositories are getting stars. Sorting by languages a quite useful as well to get relevant repositories that might interest you.\nThe one thing that bothers me is the amount of asian repositories that are filling up the list that has no english translation so if there would be a way do filter these this would make it even more useful as a resource to find trends and news.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Development News üë®‚Äçüíª"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/development-news/"}}}
