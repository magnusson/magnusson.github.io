Had to play so slow and using savestate to be able to progress. Even though the game is only five levels the lack of health and almost unavoidable hits makes it very hard. I felt that the controls and movement was a bit clunky, this did not help with making the experience a better one. I did not confirm this but I think I encountered a bug at the last level where I completed the code but the robot ninjas did not get to the top quick enough to fight each other so it resulted in a game over...</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostages_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rescue: The Embassy Mission</a></h2>\n<p>Kind of fun little game, would like to try a modern version of the same gameplay if that exist. I only played the easiest mode and still had a hard time with the last mission that I felt was really stressful to complete in time.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun.Smoke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gun.Smoke</a></h2>\n<p>Did never really figure out what the boots or guns did that I picked up since I was so busy button mashing. Getting the horse really helped getting through the levels since you no longer got oneshot from the inevitable shoot you will run into.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Out!!_(NES)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Punch-Out!!</a></h2>\n<p>A real classic, played it as a kid but for obvious reasons I never made it very far... Some fights took a couple of tries to figure out the moves. But I could only make it to Super Macho Man without savestates but here I really needed to use it to figure out the and win the fight. The last fight took forever and had to use savestate here as well so I would not be stuck on this game for several days.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_II_(NES_video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ghostbusters II</a></h2>\n<p>I did not like the controls in this game and it was so hard to avoid dying. It was frustrating to complete even with using savestates. The Statue of Liberty part was really confusing and I did not really understand what I was doing other than playing some Space Invader game (maybe that all it was), it gave me lots of one ups for the coming levels so I guess I should not complain.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project NES Update 5 ðŸ¥Š"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-nes-update-5/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
