Metal Gear was a great example of this, not sure how many hours it took to get through that one.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(NES_video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jurassic Park</a></h2>\n<p>This was a game for my taste. I mostly enjoyed it, plenty of continues and ammo. Even if the aim/controls was a bit funky at times, especially when aiming diagonal, overall the game felt solid. I really hated the mystery boxes that could either kill you our give you a continue so I mostly choose to ignore them.\nI never understood the NPC guys you needed to save at the T-Rex boss so I just ended up spamming the boss as fast as possible to avoid having to deal with them.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Off_Road\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Super Off Road</a></h2>\n<p>Somewhat fun racing game, I did not do that well and made it to race 25 or something. Could not find if the game is endless if you do well enough. I often got stuck on curves trying to take them way too tight making me place second or third on some races.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufouria:_The_Saga\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ufouria: The Saga</a></h2>\n<p>Never heard or seen anything about this game before. But I am glad I got to play it. A really solid and fun game! I just enjoyed it from start to finish, fun characters to play and even the bosses (though often similar) was very enjoyable. Would really recommend playing through this game.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Metal Gear</a></h2>\n<p>I really wanted to like this game, played it as a kid but got nowhere and I now understand why. The beginning you get thrown right into the action and it takes quite a few deaths to get used to the game. I was using the map that came with the game to figure out and find my way which made it less painful to grind through. My first playthrough I ended up softlocked because I accidentally killed hostages when skipping text so I could not get the rank for the compass and the Rocket launcher. Not sure I would have figured out how to get them by myself even if I had the correct rank since it was a bit cryptic and I got it spoiled for me when looking up why the rooms where empty.</p>\n<p>The game was enjoyable even with the bits that where really annoying like the pitfalls and rollers that oneshot you. I guess the most annoying part was dying and having to run so far each time, especially at the start of the game.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project NES Update 4 ðŸ¦•"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-nes-update-4/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
