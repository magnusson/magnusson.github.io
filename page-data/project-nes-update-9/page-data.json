The more normal levels was mostly confusing and it was hard to know where to go and what the goal was.\nThe platforming was not enjoyable but it was not as bad as the previous game I played in this series.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_Z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Section Z</a></h2>\n<p>Not at all my kind of game. Gave up pretty early on to figure out the way myself. I never really understood the controls and how to use the missiles and such.\nThe amount of spamming shoot was a bit tiring. Not a good experience at all.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lemmings</a></h2>\n<p>Such frustrating and hard game. Trying to hit the right lemming in the cluster and building at the right pixel. The first two difficulties felt enjoyable but the later two are so hard and you have to figure out so many tricks to be able to progress. This was probably the longest game I've played this far.</p>\n<p>But it was all worth it with the nice message about being one of the elite of the game playing circles in the end screen.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_III:_Dracula%27s_Curse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a></h2>\n<p>Really fun game, it has it parts that gets tricky with the knockbacks into the abyss. With unlimited continues it never starts to get frustrating. I did not really use the alternative characters so I completed most levels with Trevor.</p>\n<p>I don't think that I've played this game before, but for some reason I remembered the last boss really well so I might have completed this game before.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project NES Update 9 ðŸ¦‡"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-nes-update-9/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
