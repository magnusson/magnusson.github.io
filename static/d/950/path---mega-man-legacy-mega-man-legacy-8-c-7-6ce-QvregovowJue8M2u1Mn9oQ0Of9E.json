{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Rickard Magnusson"}},"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have recently had a urge to play some of the older retro games I remember from a long time ago. So I looked through my Steam library to find that I still had not completed the Mega Man Legacy Collection I picked up a few years ago. The first collection is the six first Mega Man games released for the NES and it still has the same feel as if you were playing on the NES. With too many sprites on the screen you will have lag and the almost pixel perfect jump you are trying to do on your last life over the spikes is exactly as frustrating as I remember it as a kid.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game I got flashback from the invisible block parts that you had to figured out the correct pattern to jump, either it resulted in your death by spikes or you fell down half the map and had to redo parts over and over again. Then you get to the Gutsman's stage in Mega Man 1 and at the start of the level get to the green lifts that for me is really hard to get good timing on or when you get to the parts where you have to drop down and make a guess on where the spikes will be and hope to choose the correct path or you will of course die again.</p>\n<p>All these obstacles mixed with the guessing game for what boss you should try next with the weapons you have gathered so far makes the experience as hard as I remember it being playing it as a kid. At least now I can really appreciate the levels a lot more with how they are structured and the way they are introducing new enemies and obstacles. You first get to see the mechanic and later in the stages get to see the same mechanics being used in a different more difficult environment.\nThis made me remember an old video I saw years ago on how the design of Mega Man levels introduces the player to enemies and goes on to talk about the intro stage in Mega Man X and what it teaches you from just playing.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.26865671641791%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8FpigqfcvlM\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>One thing I have yet to mention that I think is worth mentioning is that this Legacy Collection comes with a Challange Mode that throws you right into different aspects of the games. Some challenges are just straight up boss rushes where you get thrown right into the bosses and has to complete them in a certain amount of time while other challenges throws you into different areas mixed from different games. Some are easier than others but I had a lot of fun playing through them even though I have yet to complete them all in my 30+ hours of playtime.</p>\n<p>I am currently on the second Legacy Collection where I just completed Mega Man 7 and have started to go through Mega Man 8 which is the first game to introduce voice acting and animated cutscenes that gives really makes you wonder what they were thinking with this one. The gameplay is mostly what to be expected from a Mega Man game so I'm still enjoying it but it feels a bit out of place for the series. But I will probably comeback and write about the second Legacy Collection when I have completed the game in it as well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mega Man Legacy Collection"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mega-man-legacy/mega-man-legacy/"}}
