The games felt a bit long to be able to enjoy playing on a mobile but I enjoyed the gameplay so I moved over to the computer and have been grinding games since then.</p>\n<p>The concept of the game is really simple. You build an army of heroes and place them on your chess-like board and then the fights will occur automatically versus other players.\nYour army is built with different traits that will match up with different heroes to get the bonus from it.\nSome of the traits are warrior that gives warriors more armor or troll that gives trolls attack speed.</p>\n<p>Every round you get a choice of five random heroes you can buy. So you are very much at the hands of the luck of the draw and be able to do the best with what you get.\nThis can be frustrating at times but be so rewarding when you finally can finish that synergy you were looking at and your battles turns in your favor because of it.</p>\n<p>With all the different synergies and heroes you can pick from it makes for really interesting decisions you have to make.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 825px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 42.86941580756014%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"gameboard heroes\" title src=\"/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/94428/gameboard_heroes.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/48ec2/gameboard_heroes.jpg 206w,\n/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/23718/gameboard_heroes.jpg 413w,\n/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/94428/gameboard_heroes.jpg 825w,\n/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/5efe4/gameboard_heroes.jpg 1238w,\n/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/7130b/gameboard_heroes.jpg 1650w,\n/static/f5608884d1e4eef71a8a35614e5bc7a2/037be/gameboard_heroes.jpg 2328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\">\n  </span>","frontmatter":{"title":"Underlords ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ°"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/underlords/"}}
