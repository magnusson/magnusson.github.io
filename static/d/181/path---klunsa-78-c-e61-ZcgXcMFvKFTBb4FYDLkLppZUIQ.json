To set up the connection all I need is a enter my application keys and you are up and running.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import * as firebase from 'firebase/app'\nimport 'firebase/database'\n\nconst firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp({\n  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY,\n  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN,\n  databaseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL,\n  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,\n  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET,\n  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,\n  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID,\n})\n\nexport default firebaseApp\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the firebase connection set up all you do to get the data from the database is to set a up a ref to the data.\nThis creates an ref to the players object in a lobby with the set <code>gameId</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const playersRef = firebaseApp.database().ref(`${gameId}/players`)\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the ref available there I use two functions <code>.once()</code> and <code>.on()</code>.\nI use <code>.once()</code> to fetch the data from the database if there already is someone in the lobby and updates it with a the current players.\nUsing <code>.on()</code> works like a listener for changes on the reference. When a player joins the lobby we update the state and can start the game.</p>\n<p>I started using <a href=\"https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base\">re-base</a> but decided against it because I wanted to try using only the Firebase API.\nUsing re-base you could simplify the code quite a bit using <a href=\"https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base#syncstateendpoint-options\"><code>syncState</code></a>.\nThis is what I probably will use if I decide to refactor this some day.</p>\n<h1>React Hooks</h1>\n<p>Another reason for this project was to get used to using the somewhat new Hooks API.\nWhen I first started using Hooks I was really impressed with how much cleaned the code looks. I think this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1056594421079261185\">tweet</a> really shows how big of a difference it makes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Klunsa ✊✋✌"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/klunsa/"}}
